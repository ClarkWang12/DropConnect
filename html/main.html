            <p>A common problem associated with neural networks (and learning algorithms in general) is that they perform much better on training data than
 testing data. When a neural network over-fits, the neurons learn the training set by rote rather than gradually adapting and learning to generalize from the input features.

<p>The <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0580.pdf">Dropout</a> model  proposes to alleviate the issue of overfitting by randomling ''dropping 
out'' some of the activation in each layer during training (Hinton et al.). The dropout serves to  anonymizes the data and make over-fitting much more difficult for the network. 
In fact, training with dropout prevents complex co-adaptations that arise in the training data. By removing
each neurons reliance on the other layers, each neuron on its own must retain more information. The result is a robust and efficient way to 
perform model averaging with neural networks (Hinton et al.).
<p> Our final project revolves around a generalization of Hinton's Dropout, called DropConnect. In this approach, random connections between neurons are 
dropped between layers rather than random activations (Wan et al.). We call DropConnect a generalization of Dropout because Dropout
 is a special case of DropConnect: i.e. when we drop all the weights connecting a neuron in layer <i>i</i> to a neuron in layer <i>i+</i> 1.
<p> If we imagine our no-drop neural network as pictures below:
<center><img src="http://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/nn.jpg" height = "125" border = "0" alt = "no-drop network"> </center>
A Dropout network is then
<center><img src="http://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/nn_do.jpg" height = "125" border = "0" alt = "dropout network"> </center>
And finally a DropConnect network may be conceptualized as
<center><img src="http://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/nn_dc.jpg" height = "125" border = "0" alt = "no-drop network"> </center>
These images are due to <a href = "http://cs.nyu.edu/~wanli/dropc/">Wan</a> et al.
The scope of this project first and foremost includes an implementation of the DropConnect algorithm. This requires modification of an existing
 feed-forward network both in the training and inference step. With an implementation in hand, our aim is to then survey the performance of 
traditional feedforward-backpropigate against our DropConnect network.
