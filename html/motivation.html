            <p> In our discussion of neural networks, and especially in the text, we have hoped to model the biological processes of the brain. It is interesting to think that while Support Vector Machine have been touted as one of the most advanced breakthroughs in the field in the last 20 years, they are simply a neural network with a hidden layer. Granted, SVMs may have better theoretical performance when compared to a neuarl network, but the point is taken.
<p>A far cry from the periofic firings of a CPU's clockcycle, neurons in the brain must deal with a high degree of irregulatiry in the 
signals they process. In fact, "although it is generally agreed that neurons signal information through sequences of action potentials,
 the neural code by which information is transferred through the cortex remains elusive" (<a href = "http://redwood.berkeley.edu/vs265/s\
hadlen-newsome1.pdf">Shadlen et al.</a>). The strictly feedforward neural network crudely mimics the way information is propigated through our brain. Not only may neurons provide only partial information to others but in some cases the firing is pureley coincidental and should not elicit a response. In other cases some neurons can condense the information they recieve and pass on a distilled version of the signal recieved from the presynaptic neuron (re: feature detection).
<p> Take for instance the pacemaker cells found in our involuntary muscles, like the the heart, the brain, and our digestive system. These cells "fire almost periodically in spite of intrinsic sources of noise" [1]. In stark contrast are the pyramidal neurons which appear in areas vital to human cognition: the cerebral cortex (perception, language, consciousness), the hippocampus (memory retention), and the amygdala (emotion).
<p> The higher functioning portions of our brain are composed of neurons that fail to obey the "integrate and fire" mechanism. Instead,
 more realistic models of membrane potential undergo a "random walk between resting and potential spike threshold" and have "loosely been approximated by a Poisson process" (Shadlen et al.).
<p>The Dropout and DropConnect models, on a conceptual level, introduce <a href = "http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuronal_noise">
neuronal noise</a> to the traditional neural network model to train models robust to overfitting. As discussed in the introduction, during the training phase a DropConnect network passes on only a randomly selected subset of signals, achieved by masking the weight matrix at each layer with a binary matrix drawn from a Bernoulli(p) distribution. We discuss the implementation details as well as the statistical underpinnings in the ensuing section.
